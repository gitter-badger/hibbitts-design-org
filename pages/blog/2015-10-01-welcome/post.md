I'll be sharing my notes, thoughts and experiments about the open source aspects of my design work.  

The initial focus will be my flipped-LMS approach, using the [Grav CMS](http://www.getgrav.org) along with [GitHub](https://github.com/) as an open and multi-device friendly alternative front-end to a LMS.
