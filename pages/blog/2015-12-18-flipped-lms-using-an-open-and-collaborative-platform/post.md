Just in time for the holidays, here is the ~~second~~ third iteration of some visualizations I've been working on recently:
* Flipped-LMS
* Open and collaborative Web platform
* Flipped-LMS approach using an open and collaborative platform (where the magic really happens)

As a bonus, here is how I use [Grav](http://getgrav.org), [GitHub](http://github.com) and [Deploy](http://deployhq.com) all together to support an open and collaborative flipped-LMS approach:

It's also a good time to review why we would want to flip the LMS using an open and collaborative platform, and the related experience design goals of doing so:

Why flip the LMS?
* Support pedagogical goals unmet by current LMS/platform
* Increase capability of access, sharing and collaboration
* Deliver a better student (and facilitator) experience  

Experience design goals:
* For Students
    * Engaging
    * Organized
    * Relevant
    * Convenient
    * Enjoyable  
<br>
* For Facilitator(s)
    * Controllable (i.e. manageable)
    * Pliable (i.e. flexible)
    * Efficient
    * Enjoyable (hey, instructors are people too...)
