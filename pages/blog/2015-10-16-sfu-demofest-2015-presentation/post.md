I am excited to be presenting my approach of a flipped-LMS at Simon Fraser University's DEMOFest 2015 on November 24th. Here is the draft of my session:

**Title**
Flipping the LMS: Benefits, and lessons learned, of using an alternative front-end to Canvas

**Description**
A flipped-LMS is where an open platform, in the control of 
instructors and students, is an alternative front-end to the 
institutional LMS.

With this approach, instructors can immediately start to create better experiences for students and themselves. Deep-links to any needed LMS elements (i.e. assignment submissions, discussion forums, grades, etc.) with flow-through for user authentication is the only back-end requirement. A flipped-LMS can also support a student-centered learning ecology.
