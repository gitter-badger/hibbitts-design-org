Recently the question of how does a traditional LMS usage compare to a flipped LMS approach has come up. Here are my initial thoughts so far, based on my experiences with several different LMS implementations:

|Traditional LMS Implementation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Flipped-LMS Approach |
|:------------- |:-------------
|Institutional Control |   Instructor & Student Control  |
| Closed |  Open |
| Locked-down | Pliable |
| Slow | Efficient
| Proprietary | Standards |
| Solitary | Collaborative |
| Stationary | Portable |
