A flipped-LMS is where an open platform, in the control of instructors and students, is an alternative front-end to the institutional LMS. With a flipped-LMS approach, instructors can create better experiences for students & themselves _today_. Deep-links to needed LMS elements (i.e. assignment submissions, discussion forums, grades, etc.) are the only requirement.
