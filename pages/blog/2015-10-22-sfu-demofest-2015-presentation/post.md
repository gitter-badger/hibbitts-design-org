I am excited to be presenting my approach of a Flipped-LMS at Simon Fraser University's [DEMOFest 2015](https://www.sfu.ca/tlc/programming/special/demofest-2015.html) on November 24th.

Here is the draft description of my session:

**Flipping the LMS: Benefits and Lessons Learned of Using an Alternative Front-end to Canvas**

A flipped-LMS is where an open platform, in the control of
instructors and students, is an alternative front-end to the
institutional LMS.

With this approach, instructors can immediately start to create better experiences for students and themselves. Deep-links to any needed LMS elements (i.e. assignment submissions, discussion, grades, etc.) with flow-through for user authentication is the only back-end requirement. A flipped-LMS can also support a student-centered learning ecology.
