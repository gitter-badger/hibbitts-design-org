So, why would course facilitators want to utilize a flipped-LMS approach? Here are some initial reasons that come to mind:

* To support your pedagogical goals
* To enable an open practice for you and your students
* To deliver a better student (and facilitator!) experience
* To avoid data lock-in with the current institutional LMS
* To increase flexibility over such aspects as access, sharing, etc.
