While every project needs are different, I am finding that database-based CMS platforms such as WordPress are often overblown for the needs of _individual_ web-savvy educators/publishers. In contrast, flat-file CMS platforms offer simplicity and control. Here are some of the key reasons I am now focusing on using modern flat-file CMS's for my development work (especially when implementing a [flipped LMS](../redefining-a-flipped-lms-approach) approach):

* Modern
 *  Modern PHP code (i.e. reliability, speed, extensibility, etc.)
 *  Use of current standards (i.e. Markdown, Twig, YAML, etc.)
 *  Modular/customizable content chunks (i.e. reuse of content)
 *  Further separation of content (i.e. files) from presentation
* Flat-file
 *  No database means less (or no) IT involvement needed
 *  Content stored in text files rather than in a database (often translating into faster page access times)
 *  Takes full advantage of the collaborative ecosystem now available (i.e. GitHub)
 *  Increased portability, as moving a site now only requires simply copying files to another location
 *  All template and content files are 100% version controllable, which also supports multiple contributors

So, what is my favorite modern flat-file CMS right now? Without a doubt the rising star in this space is [Grav](http://www.getgrav.org). After trying out a number of flat-file CMS's, including  [Kirby](http://getkirby.com/) and [Statamic](http://statamic.com/), I found Grav has a perfect mix of flexibility and ease of use. In addition, Grav is backed up with [solid documentation](http://learn.getgrav.org/) and [community support](http://getgrav.org/forum).
